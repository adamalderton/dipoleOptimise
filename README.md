# dipoleOptimise

This repo holds a large proportion of code used to implement an algorithm used to optimise the configuration of a set of discrete scattering dipoles. This was developed as part of my masters project for my MPhys Physics degree from the University of Exeter. The project was titled "Inverse Design of Passive Photonic Devices with Coupled Scattering Electric Dipoles".

Other versions of the implementation algorithm are available on request. Additionally, the final 7500 word dissertation is also available on request.
